Typing on an Apple Watch
## People Should be able to type on an Apple Watch and IDK why the Cookster hasn't implemented this already.
- Using new and improved predictive text, every letter you type there are letters that are likely to come after it.
- For example, the letter p is most likely to be followed by the letter e. e is likely to be followed by the letter n, n by the letter i, and so on.
- I don't know enough about neural net AI to see if this problem requires any AI of any kind, it probably does, but IDK how to do AI.
